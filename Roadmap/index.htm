    <h1>Front End Developer Roadmap!</h1>
  </div>
  </div>
  <div class="top-container">
    <div class="the-start">
    <h2>The Start</h2>
    <img src="images/innovation.png" alt="innovation-image"class="innovation-image">
    <p>Begining my front end developer journey I have focused on using HTML and CSS, and thats all I currently know. The path I am
      taking on my journey is from <a href="https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-web-development-bootcamp/">Angela Yu's udemey course.</a> I have just completed Section 5 Intermediate CSS.
      At this point I plan to take a small break from progressing through the course to solidify my HTML and CSS skills. I will be
      using the <a href="https://www.frontendmentor.io/home">Front End Mentor</a> site to practice my HTML and CSS. On the <a href="https://www.frontendmentor.io/home">Front End Mentor</a> their is a bunch of challenges to complete
      for people of all different skill levels. After spending some time practicing my HTML and CSS I will be moving on the the next
      section of the course, Bootstrap. Bootstrap is a css framework to help make designing with CSS a bit easier.</p>

    <h2>Actually Programing</h2>
    <img src="images/programming.png" alt="programing-image"class="programing-image">
    <p class="actually-p">Now that I can build a pretty basic website, my next step is to spice it up! To do that I will be learning Javascript next,
      and with javascript I will be able to make pages more reactive. In this stage I will be using section 9-13 of Angela Yu's udemey course
      i'm not to sure what the contents are yet, but I would assume it will be walking me through the building of some apps and other cool
      stuff. This will be the point where I take a long break from my Udemey course, to continue practice what I have learned. I wasnt to really
      lock in my HTML, CSS, and Javascript skills before moving any further. At some point in this stage, I will start applying for some Developer
      positions, but my main focus will still be mastering my craft.</p>
    <h3>Side Project</h3>
    <img src="images/nodejs.png" alt="nodejs-icon"class="nodejs-icon">
    <p>At some point i'm going to have to learn a small amount of node.js so that I can build my own small store website. Plan to make a few small stores
      could possibly be a good source of side money/contract work while still learning how to code.</p>

  <div class="bottom-container">
    <div class="after-job">
    <h2>After I Obtain a Programing Job</h2>
    <p>After securing my first job as a front end developer and getting comfortable working there I plan to learn alot more about blockchain and web 3,
      after all Solana NFT's are what started me on this journey. I will learn the javascript fullstack, before starting to learn either rust or solidity
      to write smart contracts on the blockchain. At some point in the future I will be one of the developers for a succsessful NFT project.</p>
